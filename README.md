We created a web program that takes in a hex code color value from a user and returns paintings from a database that are comprised of that particular (or near) color. We are also able to link paintings to each other by similarity in colors. This project would serve useful to students who are possibly doing research regarding color (for example, researching color trends across different art eras).

Our database of paintings was retrieved and filtered from the Harvard Art Museum's API.
